# Agora — Structured Multi-Agent Debate System

Agora runs structured debates between two LLM agents using a typed speech-act protocol. A Proposition agent asserts falsifiable claims, an Opposition agent challenges them across multiple dimensions, a Moderator enforces legal act sequences and termination conditions, and a Synthesiser produces an argument map after closure.

Supports any combination of Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and Perplexity models — including cross-provider debates (e.g. Claude vs Gemini). Runs locally with no external services beyond the LLM APIs.

Built by [Mo Shehu](https://mohammedshehu.com).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shehuphd/agora
cd agora
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env          # add at least one LLM key; optionally SERPER_API_KEY for flat-cost search
uvicorn api.main:app --reload --port 8502
```

Open [http://localhost:8502](http://localhost:8502).

## Debate protocol

### Speech acts

| Act | Who | Description |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| ASSERT | Proposition | Introduce a falsifiable claim |
| CHALLENGE | Opposition | Attack a claim; multi-angle (up to 3 per act, one paragraph each) |
| REVISE | Proposition | Narrow or update a challenged claim |
| DEFEND | Proposition | Justify a challenged claim with new evidence |
| CONCEDE | Opposition | Yield a point — only after ≥3 challenge types used |
| PROPOSE | Proposition | Signal readiness to close |
| STEELMAN | Opposition | (Rapoport mode) Accurately restate proposition's claim before challenging |
| ACCEPT_STEELMAN | Proposition | Accept the restatement; challenge may proceed |
| REJECT_STEELMAN | Proposition | Reject the restatement; opposition must re-state |
| STATUS | Moderator | Summarise turn; flag sourcing gaps; track termination conditions |
| CLOSE | Moderator | End the debate with a closure summary and reason |
| ARGUMENT_MAP | Synthesiser | Structured post-debate analysis |

### Challenge taxonomy

The Opposition is required to rotate through challenge types and is explicitly prompted with randomly selected unused types each turn:

`sourcing` · `premise` · `causality` · `significance` · `definition` · `comparison` · `completeness` · `consistency`

### Modes

**Standard** — Proposition asserts, Opposition challenges, Proposition defends or revises, repeat.

**Rapoport** (steelman required) — Before every challenge, Opposition must accurately restate the proposition's claim. Proposition may accept or reject the restatement. Enforces charitable interpretation.

### Termination

Hard stops (immediate): `max_turns`, `max_time_minutes`, `token_budget`.

Soft stops (Moderator-evaluated): challenge rate floor below `min_challenges` across the session, PROPOSE met with CONCEDE, repetition of previously revised claim content.

User-requested end: the End button triggers an orderly close — the Moderator receives a `user_requested_end` signal, issues a CLOSE act, and the Synthesiser runs normally.

## Supported models

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| Anthropic | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-haiku-4-5` |
| OpenAI (GPT-5) | `gpt-5.6` (Sol), `gpt-5.6-terra`, `gpt-5.6-luna`, `gpt-5` |
| OpenAI (GPT-4 / o-series) | `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`, `o1` |
| Google | `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash` |
| Perplexity | `sonar`, `sonar-pro`, `sonar-deep-research` |

Any agent role can be assigned any model from any provider. Model dropdowns are gated by key presence — a model whose provider key is absent is shown as disabled.

## Configuration

All thresholds are set per-run in the New Debate form and stored in the session record. Defaults are read from `config/defaults.yaml` and configurable in Settings.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `max_turns` | 20 | Hard turn ceiling |
| `max_time_minutes` | 15 | Wall-clock limit |
| `token_budget` | 100,000 | Aggregate token limit across all agents |
| `min_challenges` | 5 | Minimum challenge acts before soft-stop |
| `min_concessions` | 2 | Minimum concessions expected |
| `repetition_tolerance` | 2 | Max repeated claim cycles before closure |
| `aggression` | 0.5 | Opposition aggression: 0 = cautious, 1 = challenge everything |

## Web search

Debaters ground claims through web search. A neutral search backend keeps retrieval off the token budget:

| Tier | Config | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| SearXNG (preferred) | `SEARXNG_URL` in `.env` or self-host via Docker | Free |
| Serper | `SERPER_API_KEY` in `.env` | ~$1 per 1k searches |
| Provider fallback | No config needed | Token-billed (warning shown) |

The fallback chain tries SearXNG first, then Serper, then the LLM provider's built-in search. A first-launch onboarding wizard walks through setup.

## API keys

Keys are set in `.env`. The Settings screen shows whether each key is present and lets you paste a new key inline — no server restart needed. If a key causes a quota-exhaustion error mid-debate, a warning badge appears on that key in Settings and clears when the key is updated.

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_API_KEY=...
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=...
SERPER_API_KEY=...
SEARXNG_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

At least one LLM key is required. Only providers with a key present will have their models available in the debate form.

## Output

Each run creates a directory under `runs/` containing:

- `debate.db` — SQLite database with `sessions`, `acts`, and `claims` tables
- `config.json` — full run config snapshot
- `overrides.json` — log of any mid-run adjustments

Export a run (JSON or Markdown) from the history table or the debate view.

## Security

All agent prompts use a system/user message split. Agent content never appears in the system prompt. An allowlist (`_ALLOWED_ACT_TYPES`) rejects any act type a role is not permitted to emit. Input is sanitised to strip structural tags before insertion into prompts. API keys are written only to the local `.env` file and never returned in API responses.

## Tracing

All agent actions, searches, and API calls are traced via [traceact](https://github.com/traceact/traceact). Traces write to `data/traces/traces.jsonl` with 50MB rotation. The Traces screen queries them inline; the "open viewer" button launches traceact's full viewer pre-filtered to the selected run.

## Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

79 tests covering: ActType enum, state transitions, `apply_act` for all act types, `_strip_and_parse`, allowlist enforcement, content truncation, and rolling history compaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- At least one API key in `.env`: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, or `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`
- No database server — SQLite per session under `runs/`
- Docker (optional) — for self-hosted SearXNG search
